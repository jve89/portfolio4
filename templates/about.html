          <p> {{ user.username }}. You might wanna know our story and the reason behind we started this project is
            that hobbies can sometimes be difficult to find what is right for you and using <strong>Hobby
              Share</strong> as a community will make it easier for you to be introduced to trying something new. Today people
            are often getting overwhelmed by all sorts of information either from social media, news, or things on daily basis. We want to make it
              easier for people to see what is out there and get inspired to start with a new hobby. </p> <br>
              <p><strong>Hobby Share</strong> was established in the late 1990s in Manhattan,New York as a brick-and-mortar store. <br> Where book clubs were renting the place and organized
                events to share their most trending books with potential customers. A couple of years later the user behavior changed profoundly since the internet became a
                powerful source of communication and the market choose organizations like Amazon to get all the introductions of the
                best-selling books online as well as able to make a purchase. It made us rethink our business strategy and we wanted to
                create something new for our market. That is how we came up with the idea that if people can share their hobbies online it will create
                a sense of gathering point. </p><br>
              <p>Thus, not only books but interest of any kind is a great place to get to know each other. Today
                people are receiving
                all sorts of information from social media and other websites that can be very overwhelming for some
                people, but a
                platform like Hobby Share is able to create a channel for sharing ideas. Most importantly create an
                online community.
